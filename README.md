## Project Overview
***

In this project, I have made a hangman game using Python. Hangman is a popular word game. This game is a word game where the goals is to guess the word by selecting different letters until the word is complete.  Game is familiar to us since childhood, only we used paper and a pen for this game. This game will be interesting for adults and children, as the words are matched with different difficulties. The player will get a word and tries to guess it by suggesting letters. The player has the length of the word that has to guess, with some lifelines. You have 6 guesses to guess a letter or a word before you run out of life.
