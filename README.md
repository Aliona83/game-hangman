## Project Overview
***

In this project, I have made a hangman game using Python. Hangman is a popular word game. This game is a word game where the goals is to guess the word by selecting different letters until the word is complete.  Game is familiar to us since childhood, only we used paper and a pen for this game. This game will be interesting for adults and children, as the words are matched with different difficulties. The player will get a word and tries to guess it by suggesting letters. The player has the length of the word that has to guess, with some lifelines. You have 6 guesses to guess a letter or a word before you run out of life.

## Goals
***
#### Creater Goals
* Create a game that is easy to control.
* I want to create a bright game with graffiti and text in different colours.
* The level of play game should be average for both adults and children.
* To be able to choose to play again or quit.
* To be clearly informed how to play the game.
#### Visiter Goals
* Want to enter user name.
* I want to be able to see how many  tries I still left.
* Get warned in red if an incorrect letter was entered or such a letter was entered twice.
* Be able play again or quit the game.
* I want to get feedback if a correct or incorrect guess is made.

   * [Python]() for the main game play.
   * [GitHub]() as remote repository.
   * [Heroku]() to deploy the website.
   * [Diagram.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) to make a algorithm  for the game.
   * [Patorjk.com]() for converting text to acii art.
   * [Colorama]() For producing colored terminal text.

## Design
## Deployment
***
This project was deployed using Code Institute's mock terminal for Heroku. Below are the steps I followed to be able to deploy the terminal to the website:

  1.Create a new Heroku app on the Heroku website.
  2.Set config vars: Port and give it a value of 8000.
  3.Set buildpacks to Python and NodeJS in that order.
  4.Link the Heroku app to the repository on GitHub.
  5.Click on Deploy.
